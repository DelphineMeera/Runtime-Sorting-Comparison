# Runtime-Sorting-Comparison

- The program on execution asks for the number of inputs. So the run time input needs to be provided
- The program is designed to work for randomized input and find the time taken by each sorting algorithm
- To run the program on sorted input, execute Arrays.sort(a) 
- To run the program on reversely sorted input, execute reverseSort(a) 

Note : The sorting algorithms are working to sort in ascending order.
