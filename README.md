# Runtime-Sorting-Comparison

- The program on execution asks for the number of inputs. So the run time input needs to be provided.
- The program is designed to work for randomized input and find the time taken by each sorting algorithm.
- To run the program on sorted input, line 297 needs to be uncommented (Arrays.sort(a) method)
- To run the program on reversely sorted input, line 296 needs to be uncommented (reverseSort(a) method).

Note : The sorting algorithms are working to sort in ascending order.
